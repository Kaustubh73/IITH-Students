        <p>Welcome to StuPD, here we tell you what happens in this college and how you'll survive in here. </p>
    
        <h1>The Campus Map</h1>
        <p>
            This is going to be an interesting segment. We're going to show you the whole map of IITH which was never there before :P. \n
            Well you could've found it on Google Maps but lets be honest barely anything's understandable there. So we'll give you a completely labeled map of IITH yayy!
        </p>
        <h1>The Clubs and the Councils</h1>
        <p>
            Let's talk about the Councils! Mainly politics goes on in all of these but shh, we don't want to speak too loud otherwise they'll fine us :O.
            There are in total six different councils, yea, six, we didn't even know about half of them when we joined :P
            Don't worry, it's fine to not know about them, they barely do any noticable things so you won't even remember them.
        </p>
        <h2>The 'General' Council
        </h2>
        <p>
            The 'General' Council is an umbrella council that is supposed to look after all the other councils and also take care of the student's welfare by providing them with a zoo in the name of hostel :). You can find everyone here :D
            The General Council is leaded by two General Secretaries.One shall be girl student and another a boy.Mess Secretaries,Transport Heads and Hostel Representatives constitute the rest of the Council.The General council strives towards general welfare of the students.
        </p>
        <h2>The Scitech Council?</h2>
        <p>
            oo yea these ppl exist. The Scitech Council of IITH! They conduct meetings sometimes to teach us noobies how to do stuff :), still we don't get how to do it. Don't get stressed, only 1% of the total population knows how to do this stuff so you won't be missing much. Under this we have how many?, oh yea 9 different Sci-Tech Clubs!
            Let's be honest, do you really wanna know about each of them? Ahh okay okay, I'll tell.
        </p>
        <h2>The Cultural Council</h2>
        <p>
            Well we are not supposed to be biased but if you want to have fun, this council is the best! They do all the fun stuff(sometimes) but just like Scitech Council, you barely see them doing anything :\
            <br> This here includes 7 more clubs out of which no more than 2 will be active at a time. These can be really fun so do look out for em. 
            <br> Now a few words from them :) <br>
            We are a bunch of motivated individuals who believe that a college should have its equal share of fun & frolic along with the case studies. Our is an attempt to capture the vibrant persona of the students by offering them a platform to showcase their inner musicians, dancers, actors, painters, writers, photographers and dreamers.
            We as a cultural team are responsible for keeping the spirits alive on the campus by organizing multitude of cultural activities round the year. Be it celebration of almost every festival or frequent open air jamming sessions we make sure that every event last in your memory for a lifetime. It requires a lot of effort and planning to organize events on this scale which needs a strong, dedicated and united team with multitude of skills selection of which is a big responsibility on our part and require access to best of the students available. A sneak peak of what we do round the year.

        <h2>The Sports Council</h2>
        <p>
            Well sports! That's all you need about this. It's just a bunch of young adults playing different sports. Just get into your favorite sport or just get into any game. Start playing! We all know you haven't been playing during JEE.
            They conduct various Sports Leagues also if you're into that.
            The sports offered here are Cricket, Football, Volleyball (2), Basketball, Lawn Tennis, Table Tennis, Badminton, Squash, and Swimming.

        <h2>The Media Council</h2>
        <p>
            I barely know anything about this so I'll just yoink and twist from the web :)
            <br> 
            The media council of IITH was formed on May 2014 and is a student council that helps in taking IITH to every individual in and outside IITH. We are involved in publicizing our institute though social media, social events, etc. Media Council is currently involved in various newsletters of IITH like the academic newsletter, placement newsletter with the guidance of various faculties of IITH. We are also involved in managing all the social contacts of IITH. Apart from this, we have introduced a Student Activity Page (SAP) that updates everyone of IITH’s daily students’ activities. We also help our Student Body with the maintenance of various webpages.
        </p>
        <h2>The Mess Council</h2>
        <p>
            Mess Monitoring Council or as they call it, the MMC, helps look after the functioning of the mess and its cleanliness and food. It is supposed to represent the voice of the students I think? But wait a minute, most of the mails will get ignored so they won't do much except change the mess menu every two months or so.
            <br>
            Well, I can provide you with the mess menu if you really want it. Here it is.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>There you have it! All the different clubs and councils in IITH. Yea its a lot to take in at once but try your best</p>
